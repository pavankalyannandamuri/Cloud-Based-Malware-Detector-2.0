## Cloud-Based-Malware-Detector-2.0
DSCI6015-Midterm-2.0

# Project Overview
Welcome to the DSCI6015 SP24 Midterm Project - Cloud-based PE Malware Detection API. This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity course (DSCI 6015) for the Spring 2024 semester at the University of New Haven, instructed by Professor Vahid Behzadan.

# Project Description
This project aims to implement and deploy a machine-learning model for malware classification using the Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as either malware or benign. The project is divided into three main tasks:

# Task 1 – Building and Training the Model
In this task, AWS Sagemaker.

# Task 2 - Deploying the Model as a Cloud API
Once the model is successfully trained, it is deployed as a cloud API using AWS Sagemaker. This enables other applications to utilize the model in real-time for malware classification.

# Task 3 – Creating a Web Client
For the final task, a user-friendly web application is developed using Streamlit. Users can upload PE files(.exe), which are then converted into a feature vector. The feature vector is sent to the deployed API, and the results (Malware or Benign) are displayed to the user.

Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions for detailed implementation steps.
